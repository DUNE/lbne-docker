#+TITLE: Using =lbne-docker= to advance =lbne-build=

* Why

The =lbne-build= package holds the instructions to build the LBNE
software stack.  It would be nice to develop it in a way that it can
be tested in an ad-hoc way but on well characterized platforms.  It
would also be nice to not have to wait for unchanged parts to be built
up.  For example, if a new release leaves all the externals untouched,
we could reuse a previously built image.
